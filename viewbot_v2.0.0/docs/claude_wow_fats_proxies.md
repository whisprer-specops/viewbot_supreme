dunno how muhch use these files are to investigate but can you tell me any possible ways i could speed up the proxy check,ing process significantly not involving a greater number of thread or shorter timeout wait? like is there better and worse URLS for the destination of the proxy connection when testing perhaps? or perhaps some form of significantly faster scanning techniques that allow more concurrent scans or allow multiple scns to be run inparallel compared ot the way current scans are performed_ there must be something we can do cos frankly the ccurrent system is TERRIBLES...

Edit
I see you're looking for ways to optimize proxy checking performance without increasing thread count or reducing timeout values. Looking at the provided files, I can see some details about the Elite Proxy Switcher application. Let me analyze what's possible and suggest some optimization strategies.

Performance Optimization Strategies for Proxy Checking
Smart URL Selection for Testing
Use lightweight endpoints that respond quickly (like http://httpbin.org/ip or specialized micro-services)
Create dedicated lightweight endpoints specifically optimized for proxy testing
Use CDN-distributed endpoints to minimize geographical latency
Avoid heavy HTML pages; instead use endpoints that return minimal JSON/text responses
Connection Pooling
Implement connection pooling to reuse established connections rather than creating new ones for each test
This reduces TCP handshake overhead which is significant for proxy checking
DNS Caching
Implement aggressive DNS caching to avoid repeated DNS lookups
Pre-resolve common domains used for testing
Progressive Testing Technique
Implement a multi-stage testing approach:
First quick connectivity check (simple CONNECT method)
Only proceed to full HTTP request if connectivity succeeds
Categorize proxies based on initial response time to prioritize further testing
Batch Processing
Group proxies by geographical region and test them together
Test multiple proxy attributes in a single connection rather than establishing multiple connections
Protocol Optimization
For HTTP proxies, use HTTP/1.1 with keep-alive headers
Consider HTTP/2 where supported for multiplexing capability
Use UDP-based protocols where applicable for faster initial connections
Prioritization Algorithm
Implement a scoring system that prioritizes testing of proxies likely to be functional based on historical data
Deprioritize testing for proxies that frequently fail
Asynchronous I/O
Switch to purely asynchronous I/O operations instead of threaded model
This could allow handling many more concurrent checks without the overhead of threads
Smart Timeouts
Implement variable timeouts based on proxy location/type
Use progressive timeouts that start short and extend only if partial connection succeeds
Compression
Enable data compression in requests to reduce bandwidth requirements
Focus on header compression which is particularly beneficial for proxy testing
Binary Protocols
Consider using specialized binary protocols rather than text-based HTTP for testing
This reduces parsing overhead and network traffic
Proxy Pre-categorization
Analyze proxy addresses before testing to group by provider/netblock
Test a sample from each group first to determine if an entire block is down
Would you like me to expand on any of these approaches in particular? I could also write some sample code demonstrating implementation of the most promising ones based on your current system.
