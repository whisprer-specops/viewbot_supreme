# Implement Task Distribution
# 
# Example: Centralized Coordination with REST API
# Set Up a Flask Server on Your Droplet:
# This server will distribute tasks to other nodes.
# 
# Install Flask:
# 
# bash
#Copy code
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install python3-pip
# pip3 install Flask
# 
# 
# Create a simple Flask API:

app = Flask(__name__)

    {"task_id": 1, "url": "http://example.com/1"},
    {"task_id": 2, "url": "http://example.com/2"},

]

# Run the Flask server:
# 
# bash
# Copy code
# python3 your_flask_app.py
# 
# Worker Nodes (Other Devices/Computers) Fetch and Execute Tasks:
# 
# 
# Example worker node script:

server_url = "http://your-droplet-ip:5000/get_task"

while True:
    try:
        response = requests.get(server_url)
        if response.status_code == 200:

# Deploy the Worker Script:
# 
# Deploy the worker script on each of your devices (computers, laptops, Raspberry Pi, etc.).
# Run the script on each device to start fetching and performing tasks.

# 
# Example: Handling node failure (simplified logic

# Deploy and Scale
# 
# - Deploy the System: Deploy your task manager (Flask API or similar) on a central server (e.g., your DigitalOcean droplet).
# - Worker Nodes: Deploy worker scripts on each node that periodically report their load and receive tasks from the task manager.
# - Scaling: Add or remove nodes from the system as needed, and the dynamic load balancer will adapt to the new configuration.
# 
# Tools and Technologies
# - Load Balancing Tools: Consider using existing load balancing solutions like NGINX, HAProxy, or cloud-based load balancers
# (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancing) for more complex scenarios.
# - Monitoring and Metrics: Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or CloudWatch to track the performance and load of your nodes.
# - Distributed Task Queues: Implement task queues with tools like Celery or Redis Queue (RQ) to manage and distribute tasks across your nodes.

# Testing and Monitoring
# 
# Test Access:
# 
# From one of the allowed IP addresses, try to access your API to ensure it works.
# Try accessing the API from a non-allowed IP address to confirm that it is blocked.
# Monitor Logs:
# 
# You can monitor firewall activity and logs to ensure that your rules are working as expected.
# On ufw, you can check logs at /var/log/ufw.log.


# Best Practices
# Regularly Review IP Whitelist: Periodically review the list of allowed IP addresses to ensure that only trusted addresses have 
# access.
#  Use Strong Authentication: Even with firewall rules, it’s essential to implement strong API key or token-based authentication to 
# further secure your API.
# Combine with HTTPS: Always use HTTPS to encrypt traffic between the client and server, especially when dealing with sensitive data 
# or credentials.
# Monitor and Respond to Alerts: Set up monitoring and alerting to notify you of unauthorized access attempts or changes in firewall 
# configurations.
# 
# 
# Encryption: Use HTTPS or SSH for secure communication between nodes.
# 



# Testing and Deployment
# 
# Before fully deploying your distributed bot network, thoroughly test it:
# 
# Local Testing: Test the coordination and task distribution locally before deploying to your DigitalOcean droplet and other devices.
# Staged Rollout: Gradually add more worker nodes and increase task loads to ensure stability.



# Optimize for Performance
# 
# Finally, make sure your bot network is optimized for performance:
# 
# what is dynamic load balancing and how do i implement it please?
# Dynamic load balancing is a process that distributes tasks or requests across multiple servers, nodes, or devices in real-time, 
# adjusting the distribution based on the current load or performance of each node. The goal is to optimize resource usage, minimize 
# response time, and avoid overloading any single node in the network.
# 
# Key Concepts of Dynamic Load Balancing
# Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously monitor the performance and load on each node in the network.
# Adaptive Task Distribution: Based on the current load, dynamically adjust how tasks are distributed to ensure an even workload 
# across nodes.
# Failover and Redundancy: If a node becomes overloaded or fails, the system automatically redistributes its tasks to other nodes.

# Benefits of Dynamic Load Balancing
#  -Improved Performance: By evenly distributing tasks, each node can work efficiently without being overwhelmed.
# - High Availability: If a node fails, the system can automatically reroute tasks to other available nodes, ensuring continuous 
# operation.
# - Scalability: As your workload increases, you can easily add more nodes to the network, and the load balancer will adapt 
# accordingly.
# 
# Implementing Dynamic Load Balancing
# 
# Here’s how you can implement dynamic load balancing in your distributed bot network:


# Monitor Node Load
# 
# To dynamically balance the load, you first need to monitor the load on each node.
# This could include metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, current task count, or response time.
# 
# Example: Monitoring load in Python (using a hypothetical get_node_load() function):
# 

# Simulate getting node load (in reality, you would use actual monitoring)
def get_node_load():
    return random.uniform(0, 1)  # Returns a random load between 0 (idle) and 1 (fully loaded)
