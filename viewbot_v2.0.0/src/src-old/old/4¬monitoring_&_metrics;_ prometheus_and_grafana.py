# Monitoring and Metrics: Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or CloudWatch to track the performance and load of your nodes. 
# 
# using Prometheus and Grafana:
# 
# - Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects and stores metrics as time-series data.
# - Grafana is a powerful visualization tool that can be used to create dashboards from the metrics collected by Prometheus.


# Step 1) Install Prometheus
# 
# Download and Install Prometheus:
# 
# - First, SSH into your DigitalOcean droplet or server where you want to install Prometheus.
# - Download Prometheus:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.41.0/prometheus-2.41.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
# ```
# 
# Extract the downloaded file:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# tar xvf prometheus-*.tar.gz
# ```
# 
# Move the extracted directory:
#
# ```bash
# 
# sudo mv prometheus-2.41.0.linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/prometheus
# ```
# 
# Start Prometheus:
# Navigate to the Prometheus directory and start Prometheus:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# cd /usr/local/bin/prometheus
# './prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
# ```
# 
#  Prometheus should now be running and accessible at http://<your-droplet-ip>:9090.



# Step 2) Install Node Exporter
# 
# Node Exporter is a Prometheus exporter that collects hardware and OS metrics (such as CPU, memory, and disk usage) from your node
# 
# Download and Install Node Exporter:
# - SSH into the server where you want to collect metrics.
# - Download Node Exporter:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.5.0/node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
# ```
# 
# Extract the file:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# tar xvf node_exporter-*.tar.gz
# ```
# 
# Move the binary:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# sudo mv node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64/node_exporter /usr/local/bin/
# ```
# 
# Run Node Exporter:
# - Start Node Exporter:
# 
# ```bash
 #
 #/usr/local/bin/node_exporter &
# ```
# 
# Node Exporter will now be running and serving metrics at http://<your-droplet-ip>:9100/metrics.



# Step 3) Configure Prometheus to Scrape Metrics
# 
# Edit the Prometheus Configuration:
# Open the prometheus.yml file:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# nano /usr/local/bin/prometheus/prometheus.yml
# ````
# 
# Add a new job for Node Exporter:
# 
# ```yaml
# 
# scrape_configs:
#  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
#    static_configs:
#      - targets: ['<your-droplet-ip>:9100']
# ```
# 
# Save and exit the file (Ctrl + O to save, Ctrl + X to exit)
# Restart Prometheus:
# 
# Stop the running Prometheus instance (if running in the foreground):
# 
# ```bash
# 
# pkill prometheus
# ```
# 
# Restart Prometheus with the updated configuration:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml &
# ```



# Step 4) Install Grafana
# 
# Download and Install Grafana:
# Follow these steps on your server:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
# sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install grafana
# ```
# 
# Start Grafana:
# 
# Start the Grafana service:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# sudo systemctl start grafana-server
# sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
# Grafana should now be accessible at http://<your-droplet-ip>:3000.
# ```



# Step 5) Configure Grafana to Use Prometheus as a Data Source
# Log in to Grafana:
# 
# Navigate to http://<your-droplet-ip>:3000 in your web browser.
# The default login credentials are:
# - Username: admin
# - Password: admin
# 
# Add Prometheus as a Data Source:
# - Once logged in, click on the gear icon (Configuration) in the left-hand menu, then select Data Sources
# - Click Add Data Source.
# - Select Prometheus from the list of available data sources.
# - Set the URL to http://<your-droplet-ip>:9090.
# - Click Save & Test to ensure the connection is working.



# Step 6) Create a Dashboard in Grafana
# 
# Create a New Dashboard:
# - Click on the + icon in the left-hand menu and select Dashboard.
# - Click Add New Panel to start building your dashboard.
# 
# Add Metrics to the Dashboard:
# - In the panel editor, select your Prometheus data source.
# - Use PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) to add metrics. For example:
# 
# CPU Usage: rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="user"}[1m])
# Memory Usage: node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes
# Disk Usage: node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/"}
# 
# 
# Save and Customize:
# 
# Once you’ve added the desired metrics, click Apply to add the panel to your dashboard.
# 
# Repeat the process to add more panels and create a comprehensive monitoring dashboard.
# 
# By setting up Prometheus and Grafana you can effectively monitor the performance and load of your nodes in real-time.
# These tools provide powerful visualization, alerting, and analysis capabilities that are crucial for managing a distributed bot network
# or any other large-scale system. With the provided scripts and instructions, you can quickly get started with setting up a robust
# monitoring system.
# 
# Depending on your chosen architecture, implement a system where tasks are distributed to your nodes.
# E xample: Centralized Coordination with REST API
# Set Up a Flask Server on Your Droplet:
# 
# This server will distribute tasks to other nodes.
# 
# Install Flask:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install python3-pip
# pip3 install Flask
# ```
# 
# Create a simple Flask API:

app = Flask(__name__)

tasks = [
    {"task_id": 1, "url": "http://example.com/1"},
    {"task_id": 2, "url": "http://example.com/2"},
    # Add more tasks as needed
]

@app.route('/get_task')
def get_task():
    if tasks:
        return jsonify(tasks.pop(0))
    else:
        return jsonify({"message": "No more tasks"}), 404

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)#


# Run the Flask server:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# python3 your_flask_app.py
# Worker Nodes (Other Devices/Computers) Fetch and Execute Tasks:
# ```
#  
# Each worker node can be a simple script that requests tasks from the central server, performs the task, and optionally reports the result.
# 
# Example worker node script:

server_url = "http://your-droplet-ip:5000/get_task"

while True:
    try:
        response = requests.get(server_url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            task = response.json()
            print(f"Performing task {task['task_id']} on {task['url']}")
            # Simulate performing the task
        else:
            print("No more tasks available.")
            break
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to get task: {e}")
        break


# Deploy the Worker Script:
# 
# Deploy the worker script on each of your devices (computers, laptops, Raspberry Pi, etc.).
# 
# Run the script on each device to start fetching and performing tasks.

################################################################################################################

# optional:
# Automate and Scale
# 
# To manage the network efficiently:
# 
# Automation with Docker:
# - Dockerize both the Flask API server and the worker nodes for easier deployment and scaling.
# - Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes to manage and scale your distributed bot network.
#
# Scaling:
#-  DigitalOcean Droplet Scaling: You can deploy multiple droplets, each running the Flask API or acting as workers.
#- Load Balancing: If the task load is heavy, implement load balancing to distribute tasks more evenly across nodes.
# 
# Monitoring and Logging:
# -Implement centralized logging (e.g., using ELK Stack) to monitor the performance of your network.
# - Track task completion, errors, and other metrics to ensure smooth operation.
# 
# 
# Security Considerations
# 
# Authentication: Protect your communication channels with API keys or tokens to prevent unauthorized access.
# 
# Firewall Rules: Restrict access to your DigitalOcean droplet’s API to only known IP addresses.
# 
# Apply the Firewall to Your Droplet
# - Scroll down to the Apply to Droplets section.
# - Select the droplet(s) you want this firewall to apply to.
# - Click Create Firewall to save and apply the firewall rules.

# alternte option: automation:
# 
# i. Configuring UFW on the Droplet (Optional)
# If you prefer or need to configure the firewall directly on your droplet, you can use ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall), a user-friendly frontend for managing iptables firewall rules on Ubuntu and Debian systems.
# 
# Step 1: Install and Enable UFW
# Install UFW (if not already installed):
# 
# ```bash
# 
# sudo apt-get install ufw
# ```
# 
# Enable UFW:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# sudo ufw enable
# ```
# 
# Step ii: Set Default Policies
# Set the default rules to deny all incoming traffic and allow all outgoing traffic:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# sudo ufw default deny incoming
# sudo ufw default allow outgoing
# ```
# 
# Step iii: Allow SSH Access
# Allow SSH access so you don’t lock yourself out:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# sudo ufw allow ssh
# ```
# 
# Step iv: Allow Access to Your API from Specific IPs
# Allow access to the API from a specific IP address:
# 
# If your API runs on port 5000:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.1 to any port 5000
# ```
# 
# Repeat this command for each IP address that you want to allow access.
# Verify the UFW Rules:
# 
# List the current UFW rules to ensure they are set correctly:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# sudo ufw status
# ```
# 
# You should see something like:
# 
# css
# 
# To                         Action      From
# --                         ------      ----
# 5000                       ALLOW       203.0.113.1
# 22                         ALLOW       Anywhere
# 
# 
# Step v: Deny All Other Traffic to the API Port
# Explicitly deny all other traffic to the API port:
# 
# ```bash
# 
# sudo ufw deny 5000
# ```
# 
# vi. Testing and Monitoring
# 
# Test Access:
# 
# From one of the allowed IP addresses, try to access your API to ensure it works.
# Try accessing the API from a non-allowed IP address to confirm that it is blocked.
# Monitor Logs:
# 
# You can monitor firewall activity and logs to ensure that your rules are working as expected.
# On ufw, you can check logs at /var/log/ufw.log.



# commentas on Best Practices
# Regularly Review IP Whitelist: Periodically review the list of allowed IP addresses to ensure that only trusted addresses have access.
#  Use Strong Authentication: Even with firewall rules, it’s essential to implement strong API key or token-based authentication to further secure your API.
# Combine with HTTPS: Always use HTTPS to encrypt traffic between the client and server, especially when dealing with sensitive data or credentials.
# Monitor and Respond to Alerts: Set up monitoring and alerting to notify you of unauthorized access attempts or changes in firewall configurations.
# 
# 
# Encryption: Use HTTPS or SSH for secure communication between nodes.



# Testing and Deployment
# 
# Before fully deploying your distributed bot network, thoroughly test it:
# 
# Local Testing: Test the coordination and task distribution locally before deploying to your DigitalOcean droplet and other devices.
# Staged Rollout: Gradually add more worker nodes and increase task loads to ensure stability.



# Optimize for Performance
# 
# Finally, make sure your bot network is optimized for performance:
# 
# what is dynamic load balancing and how do i implement it please?
# Dynamic load balancing is a process that distributes tasks or requests across multiple servers, nodes, or devices in real-time, adjusting the distribution based on the current load or performance of each node. The goal is to optimize resource usage, minimize response time, and avoid overloading any single node in the network.
# 
# Key Concepts of Dynamic Load Balancing
# Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously monitor the performance and load on each node in the network.
# Adaptive Task Distribution: Based on the current load, dynamically adjust how tasks are distributed to ensure an even workload across nodes.
# Failover and Redundancy: If a node becomes overloaded or fails, the system automatically redistributes its tasks to other nodes.
# 
# Benefits of Dynamic Load Balancing
#  -Improved Performance: By evenly distributing tasks, each node can work efficiently without being overwhelmed.
# - High Availability: If a node fails, the system can automatically reroute tasks to other available nodes, ensuring continuous operation.
# - Scalability: As your workload increases, you can easily add more nodes to the network, and the load balancer will adapt accordingly.
# 
# Implementing Dynamic Load Balancing using FlaskAPI: 
# 
# Here’s how you can implement dynamic load balancing in your distributed bot network:
# 
# 
# 1. Monitor Node Load
# 
# To dynamically balance the load, you first need to monitor the load on each node.
# This could include metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, current task count, or response time.
# 
# Example: Monitoring load in Python (using a hypothetical get_node_load() function):
# 
# 
# Simulate getting node load (in reality, you would use actual monitoring)
def get_node_load():
    return random.uniform(0, 1)  # Returns a random load between 0 (idle) and 1 (fully loaded)

nodes = {
    "node1": {"ip": "192.168.1.1", "load": get_node_load()},
    "node2": {"ip": "192.168.1.2", "load": get_node_load()},
    "node3": {"ip": "192.168.1.3", "load": get_node_load()},
}

for node, info in nodes.items():
    print(f"{node} - IP: {info['ip']}, Load: {info['load']:.2f}")


def get_least_loaded_node(nodes):
    # Find the node with the lowest load
    return min(nodes, key=lambda k: nodes[k]['load'])

def assign_task(task):
    node = get_least_loaded_node(nodes)
    print(f"Assigning task {task} to {node} (IP: {nodes[node]['ip']})")

# Example tasks
tasks = ["task1", "task2", "task3"]

for task in tasks:
    assign_task(task)



app = Flask(__name__)

# Example node load data
nodes = {
    "node1": {"ip": "192.168.1.1", "load": get_node_load()},
    "node2": {"ip": "192.168.1.2", "load": get_node_load()},
    "node3": {"ip": "192.168.1.3", "load": get_node_load()},
}

@app.route('/assign_task', methods=['POST'])
def assign_task():
    task = request.json.get('task')
    node = get_least_loaded_node(nodes)
    nodes[node]['load'] += 0.1  # Simulate load increase
    return jsonify({"assigned_node": node, "ip": nodes[node]['ip'], "task": task})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)



def handle_node_failure(failed_node):
    print(f"Node {failed_node} failed. Redistributing tasks...")
    # Redistribute tasks to other nodes
    for task in tasks_assigned_to(failed_node):
        assign_task(task)

# Example failure detection (simplified)
if node_load_exceeds_threshold("node1"):
    handle_node_failure("node1")


# Deploy and Scale
# 
# - Deploy the System: Deploy your task manager (Flask API or similar) on a central server (e.g., your DigitalOcean droplet).
# - Worker Nodes: Deploy w- orker scripts on each node that periodically report their load and receive tasks from the task mana# ger.
# - Scaling: Add or remove nodes from the system as needed, and the dynamic load balancer will adapt to the new configuratio# n.
# 
# Tools and Technologi#  es
# 
# - Load Balancing Tools: # Consider using existing load balancing solutions like NGINX, HAProxy, or cloud-based load balancers (e.g., AWS Elastic#  Load Balancing) for more complex scenarios.
# - Monitoring and Metrics: # Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or CloudWatch to track the performance and load of your node# s.
# - Distributed Task Queues: I#  mplement task queues with tools like Celery or Redis Queue (RQ) to manage and distribute tasks across your no#  des.
