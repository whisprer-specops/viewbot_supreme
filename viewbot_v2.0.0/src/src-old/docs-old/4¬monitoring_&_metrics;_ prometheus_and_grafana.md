# Monitoring and Metrics: Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or CloudWatch to track the performance and load of your nodes. 
# 
# i. Prometheus and Grafana
# 
# Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects and stores metrics as time-series data.
# Grafana is a powerful visualization tool that can be used to create dashboards from the metrics collected by Prometheus.


# Step 1: Install Prometheus

# Download and Install Prometheus:

# - First, SSH into your DigitalOcean droplet or server where you want to install Prometheus.
# - Download Prometheus:

# bash
# 
# wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.41.0/prometheus-2.41.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
# 


# Extract the downloaded file:
# 
# bash
# 
# tar xvf prometheus-*.tar.gz

# Move the extracted directory:
#
# Bash
# 
# sudo mv prometheus-2.41.0.linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/prometheus

# Start Prometheus:
# Navigate to the Prometheus directory and start Prometheus:
# 
# bash
# 
# cd /usr/local/bin/prometheus
# './prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml

#  Prometheus should now be running and accessible at http://<your-droplet-ip>:9090.


# Step 2: Install Node Exporter
# 
# Node Exporter is a Prometheus exporter that collects hardware and OS metrics (such as CPU, memory, and disk usage) from your node
# Download and Install Node Exporter:
# SSH into the server where you want to collect metrics.
# Download Node Exporter:

# bash
# 
# wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.5.0/node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Extract the file:
# 
# bash
# 
# tar xvf node_exporter-*.tar.gz

# Move the binary:
# 
# bash
# 
# sudo mv node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64/node_exporter /usr/local/bin/

# Run Node Exporter:
# Start Node Exporter:
# 
# bash
 #
 #/usr/local/bin/node_exporter &
 # 
# Node Exporter will now be running and serving metrics at http://<your-droplet-ip>:9100/metrics.

# Step iii: Configure Prometheus to Scrape Metrics
# 
# Edit the Prometheus Configuration:
# Open the prometheus.yml file:
# 
# bash
# 
# nano /usr/local/bin/prometheus/prometheus.yml

# Add a new job for Node Exporter:
# 
# yaml
# 
# scrape_configs:
#  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
#    static_configs:
#      - targets: ['<your-droplet-ip>:9100']
# 
# Save and exit the file (Ctrl + O to save, Ctrl + X to exit)
# Restart Prometheus:

# Stop the running Prometheus instance (if running in the foreground):
# 
# bash
# 
# pkill prometheus

# Restart Prometheus with the updated configuration:

# bash
# 
# ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml &
# 

# 
# Step 4: Install Grafana
# 
# Download and Install Grafana:
# Follow these steps on your server:
# 
# bash
# 
# sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
# sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install grafana

# Start Grafana:

# Start the Grafana service:

# bash
# 
# sudo systemctl start grafana-server
# sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
# Grafana should now be accessible at http://<your-droplet-ip>:3000.


# Step v: Configure Grafana to Use Prometheus as a Data Source
# Log in to Grafana:

# Navigate to http://<your-droplet-ip>:3000 in your web browser.
# The default login credentials are:
# - Username: admin
# - Password: admin

# Add Prometheus as a Data Source:
# - Once logged in, click on the gear icon (Configuration) in the left-hand menu, then select Data Sources
# - Click Add Data Source.
# - Select Prometheus from the list of available data sources.
# - Set the URL to http://<your-droplet-ip>:9090.
# - Click Save & Test to ensure the connection is working.
# 

# Step vi: Create a Dashboard in Grafana
# 
# Create a New Dashboard:
# - Click on the + icon in the left-hand menu and select Dashboard.
# - Click Add New Panel to start building your dashboard.
# 
# Add Metrics to the Dashboard:
# - In the panel editor, select your Prometheus data source.
# - Use PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) to add metrics. For example:
# 
# CPU Usage: rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="user"}[1m])
# Memory Usage: node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes
# Disk Usage: node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/"}
# 
# 
# Save and Customize:
# 
# Once you’ve added the desired metrics, click Apply to add the panel to your dashboard.
# 
# Repeat the process to add more panels and create a comprehensive monitoring dashboard.
# 
# By setting up Prometheus and Grafana you can effectively monitor the performance and load of your nodes in real-time.
# These tools provide powerful visualization, alerting, and analysis capabilities that are crucial for managing a distributed bot network
# or any other large-scale system. With the provided scripts and instructions, you can quickly get started with setting up a robust
# monitoring system.
# 


# Depending on your chosen architecture, implement a system where tasks are distributed to your nodes.
# E xample: Centralized Coordination with REST API
# Set Up a Flask Server on Your Droplet:
# 
# This server will distribute tasks to other nodes.
# 
# Install Flask:
# 
# bash
# 
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install python3-pip
# pip3 install Flask


# Create a simple Flask API:

app = Flask(__name__)

tasks = [
    {"task_id": 1, "url": "http://example.com/1"},
    {"task_id": 2, "url": "http://example.com/2"},
    # Add more tasks as needed
]

@app.route('/get_task')
def get_task():
    if tasks:
        return jsonify(tasks.pop(0))
    else:
        return jsonify({"message": "No more tasks"}), 404

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)#


# Run the Flask server:
# 
# bash
# 
# python3 your_flask_app.py
# Worker Nodes (Other Devices/Computers) Fetch and Execute Tasks:
# 
# Each worker node can be a simple script that requests tasks from the central server, performs the task, and optionally reports the result.
# 
# Example worker node script:
#

server_url = "http://your-droplet-ip:5000/get_task"

while True:
    try:
        response = requests.get(server_url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            task = response.json()
            print(f"Performing task {task['task_id']} on {task['url']}")
            # Simulate performing the task
        else:
            print("No more tasks available.")
            break
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to get task: {e}")
        break


# Deploy the Worker Script:
# 
# Deploy the worker script on each of your devices (computers, laptops, Raspberry Pi, etc.).
# 
# Run the script on each device to start fetching and performing tasks.



# Automate and Scale
# 
# To manage the network efficiently:
# 
# Automation with Docker:
# - Dockerize both the Flask API server and the worker nodes for easier deployment and scaling.
# - Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes to manage and scale your distributed bot network.
#
# Scaling:
#-  DigitalOcean Droplet Scaling: You can deploy multiple droplets, each running the Flask API or acting as workers.
#- Load Balancing: If the task load is heavy, implement load balancing to distribute tasks more evenly across nodes.
# 
# Monitoring and Logging:
# -Implement centralized logging (e.g., using ELK Stack) to monitor the performance of your network.
# - Track task completion, errors, and other metrics to ensure smooth operation.



# Security Considerations
# 
# Authentication: Protect your communication channels with API keys or tokens to prevent unauthorized access.
# 
# Firewall Rules: Restrict access to your DigitalOcean droplet’s API to only known IP addresses.
# 


# Step 3: Apply the Firewall to Your Droplet
# Scroll down to the Apply to Droplets section.
# Select the droplet(s) you want this firewall to apply to.
# Click Create Firewall to save and apply the firewall rules.


# 3. Configuring UFW on the Droplet (Optional)
# If you prefer or need to configure the firewall directly on your droplet, you can use ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall), a user-friendly frontend for managing iptables firewall rules on Ubuntu and Debian systems.
# 
# Step 1: Install and Enable UFW
# Install UFW (if not already installed):
# 
# bash
# 
# sudo apt-get install ufw
# Enable UFW:
# 
# bash
# 
# sudo ufw enable
# Step 2: Set Default Policies
# Set the default rules to deny all incoming traffic and allow all outgoing traffic:
# 
# bash
# 
# sudo ufw default deny incoming
# sudo ufw default allow outgoing


# Step 3: Allow SSH Access
# Allow SSH access so you don’t lock yourself out:
# 
# bash
# 
# sudo ufw allow ssh


# Step 4: Allow Access to Your API from Specific IPs
# Allow access to the API from a specific IP address:
# 
# If your API runs on port 5000:
# 
# bash
# 
# sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.1 to any port 5000
# Repeat this command for each IP address that you want to allow access.
# Verify the UFW Rules:
# 
# List the current UFW rules to ensure they are set correctly:
# 
# bash
# 
# sudo ufw status
# 
# You should see something like:
# 
# css
# 
# To                         Action      From
# --                         ------      ----
# 5000                       ALLOW       203.0.113.1
# 22                         ALLOW       Anywhere


# Step 5: Deny All Other Traffic to the API Port
# Explicitly deny all other traffic to the API port:
# 
# bash
# 
# sudo ufw deny 5000
