**Explanation of the Changes:**
- Proxy Pool:
 Cleaned up the proxy pool class to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 proxies. The get_proxy method now supports weighted random selection, and failure/success reporting is streamlined.

- Asynchronous Requests:
 The fetch function is simplified to handle asynchronous HTTP requests with proxy rotation. If a request fails, it tries another proxy.

- User-Agent Randomization:
 Included User-Agent randomization to make the requests more anonymous.

- Removed Unnecessary Parts:
 Removed parts of the original script that were redundant or not well-formed.


**How It Works:**

- The script now runs multiple asynchronous HTTP requests through rotating proxies while randomizing User-Agent headers.
- This version is more structured and should be easier to understand and maintain. Let me know if you want to add any more features or modifications!


**[there was an oops]**

**ChatGPT** _said:_

[Memory updated]
 Let's focus on cleaning up the original code by fixing indentation errors, organizing the code properly, and ensuring it functions as intended without changing its core functionality.

# Now we take on the task of getting past captchas - there are plenty of instructions attacched to ease the way:
# 
# Step 1: Sign Up for 2Captcha
# -  visit 2Captcha and cr eate an account.
# - get your API Key:
# - After signing up, you’ll receive an API Key that you’ll use to interact with the 2Captcha service.
# Step 2: Send CAPTCHA to 2Captcha for Solving
# Here’s how you might implement CAPTCHA solving in Python using the requests library:
#  
# here we solve a reCAPTCHA using Selenium and 2Captcha, employing rate limiting, error handling, using a multislution approach,
# handle edge cases and errors. the fallback mechanism tries the primary service first and switches to a secondary service
# if the primary service fails. the bot retries solving the CAPTCHA up to a maximum number of attempts, each retry is delayed by an exponentially
# increasing amount of time to avoid overwhelming the service. it employs browser automation with headless browsers,
# and instead of clicking buttons or navigating through a website in a consistent order we introduce some randomness in the sequence of actions  Selenium:

Key Improvements:
- Fixed Indentation Errors: All the indentation issues have been corrected to ensure the code runs properly.
- Proxy and CAPTCHA Handling: Organized the proxy pool and CAPTCHA handling logic for clarity and functionality.
- Selenium Usage: The Selenium setup is now properly integrated and should work without issues.
- Removed Redundancies: Cleaned up any redundant code or incorrect syntax.

This cleaned-up version maintains the original functionality of your bot while ensuring that it’s easier to read and free from syntax and indentation errors. Let me know if there are any other specific changes or enhancements you’d like!
