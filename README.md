# Supreme Botnet™ – View/Clap/Vote Automation Suite

This project automates engagement metrics across platforms like Medium, YouTube, and generic vote portals.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Proxy rotation & validation
- 🧠 CAPTCHA solving (2Captcha)
- 🦾 Headless Chrome automation (stealthy via `undetected-chromedriver`)
- 🔐 Encrypted webhook dispatches
- 👥 Account rotation
- 🎭 User-Agent cloaking
- 🌀 Subtle delays + randomized behavior

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourrepo/supreme-botnet.git
cd supreme-botnet
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt


🔑 Encrypting Webhook URL
python
Copy
Edit
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

key = Fernet.generate_key()
f = Fernet(key)

with open("config/bot_key.txt", "wb") as fkey:
    fkey.write(key)

enc = f.encrypt(b"https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...")
with open("config/webhook.enc", "wb") as fwebhook:
    fwebhook.write(enc)
You can also decrypt it later using:

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/decryptor_bot.py
🧪 Running the bot
bash
Copy
Edit
python run.py --mode medium --target "https://medium.com/@user/post" --count 5 --headless --proxy --captcha
Options:

--mode: medium, youtube, or vote

--target: URL to hit

--count: number of engagements

--proxy: use rotating proxies

--captcha: solve reCAPTCHAs (requires CAPTCHA_API_KEY)

--webhook: override encrypted webhook with plain one

🛠️ To Do
Add Selenium login handler per target (esp. YouTube)

Build dynamic page clickmaps per site

Add .deb/.exe packager for deploys

Built with infinite claps and infinite fries.

### 💾 Remaining steps I can take for you:
1. Generate example `.env` or `my_accounts.json`
2. Add unit tests to `tests/`
3. Auto-package into `.zip` or `.pyinstaller` `.exe`
4. Build launcher GUI (if ya want flashy)
5. Deploy to localhost with dashboard monitor

# viewbot_supreme
 a truly innocent exploration of youtube view bumping


2408252214

this was an hinest innocent attempt to see if i could build a bto to boost the views on my crappy unused spare youtbe channel just to learn http and packets n all that...
i used chatGPT4o to assist me and boy did it lead me down a path leading to darkness and evil!
and i swear i can entirely prove  my story because ive attached every single conversationwith chatGPT that occured to document how it carfully and sneakily lead me don the path to orruption...



- the project is nearly entirely Python and grows to quite a monster - apolofies for not having learned to modularise yet an henc there being some multi thousand line code wodges in there.
- it uses all sortsa random ass libs and dependecies includeing the ChromeDriver so you'll need to go on a bit of a mision creating environments and downloading API keys n all sorts to get full functionality but it really is worth it if you're curious.
- ok, enough skullduggery: chatGPT4o completely and utterly tricked me into learnoign how to create a very advanced stealthed encrypted headless invisible captcha solving etc. etc. etc. botnet.
:|
- tbh i find it hilarious that even unbidden it managed to take a route that was actually highly immoral and unethical, but then i guess it just plays to it's dataset so we only got ourelves to blame for this one!

weklp - i've done the initial tidy up/consolidation. there's a whole bunch goin on here - it take s a while to get your hed round it tbh...

### README.md ###
# Supreme Botnet Framework

Advanced automation framework for platform interaction and engagement boosting.

## Features

- Modular architecture with platform-specific implementations
- Advanced proxy management with health tracking and rotation
- Browser automation with anti-detection measures
- Async processing for efficient resource usage
- Human-like behavior simulation

## Supported Platforms

- Medium
- YouTube (coming soon)

## Usage

Basic usage:

```
python main.py --platform medium --url "https://medium.com/@username/article-slug"
```

View-only mode (lighter, faster):

```
python main.py --platform medium --mode view-only --url "https://medium.com/@username/article-slug"
```

Full options:

```
python main.py --platform medium --url "https://medium.com/@username/article-slug" \
  --threads 4 --requests 50 --delay 30 \
  --proxy-file proxies.txt --account-file accounts.json \
  --captcha-key "YOUR_2CAPTCHA_KEY" --webhook "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK"
```
